ipeth-dkms for Debian
---------------------

The Debian version of ipheth provides two binary packages:

ipheth-utils - pairing utility for the iPhone tethering Linux kernel driver
ipheth-dkms - Linux kernel driver that adds support for iPhone tethering

This package provides the source code for the ipheth Linux kernel driver. The
module is automatically built and installed by DKMS for the running kernel.
